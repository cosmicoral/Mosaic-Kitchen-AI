# 🥗 Mosaic Kitchen AI

**AI-powered multicultural meal planning and grocery assistant for diverse households in the UK.**

> Built on PhD research in healthy eating practices, food waste, digital food platforms, and multicultural food consumption.

---

## 🌍 Vision

Mosaic Kitchen helps multicultural households make healthier, cheaper, and more culturally relevant food decisions.

Most meal planning applications are designed around mainstream Western diets and often overlook the needs of diverse communities. Mosaic Kitchen bridges this gap by combining AI-powered meal planning, cultural food knowledge, and grocery optimisation into a single platform.

### Research Inspiration

Mosaic Kitchen is informed by doctoral research on:

- Healthy eating practices
- Food waste reduction
- Digital food platforms
- Everyday food consumption
- Ethnicity and food culture
- Household food routines

A key insight from this research is that people often struggle with healthy and sustainable eating not because of a lack of knowledge, but because of time constraints, disrupted routines, cultural preferences, and everyday practical challenges.
